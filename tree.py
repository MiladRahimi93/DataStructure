    A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy
    to navigate and search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship
    between the nodes. 
    The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can
    have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure.

def tree_terms():

    [+] Basic Terminologies In Tree Data Structure:
    1: Parent Node: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node. {B} is the parent 
        node of {D, E}.
    2: Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node. Examples: 
        {D, E} are the child nodes of {B}.
    3: Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node.
     {A} is the root node of the tree. A non-empty tree must contain exactly one root node and exactly one path from 
     the root to all other nodes of the tree.
    4: Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes. {K, L, M, N, O, P}
     are the leaf nodes of the tree.
    5: Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node.
     {A,B} are the ancestor nodes of the node {E}
    6: Descendant: Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that node. {E,I} are the descendants of the node
     {B}.
    7: Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings. {D,E} are called siblings.
    8: Level of a node: The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level 0.
    9: Internal node: A node with at least one child is called Internal Node.
    10: Neighbour of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node.
    11: Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant.""")

    [+] Why Tree is considered a non-linear data structure?
        The data in a tree are not stored in a sequential manner i.e., they are not stored linearly. Instead, they are arranged

def tree_properties():

    [+]Properties of Tree Data Structure:
        1: Number of edges: An edge can be defined as the connection between two nodes. If a tree has N nodes then it will have
        2: (N-1) edges. There is only one path from each node to any other node of the tree.
        3: Depth of a node: The depth of a node is defined as the length of the path from the root to that node. Each edge
            adds 1 unit of length to the path. So, it can also be defined as the number of edges in the path from the root
            of the tree to the node.
        4: Height of a node: The height of a node can be defined as the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf
            node of the tree.
        5: Height of the Tree: The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf
            node of the tree.
        6: Degree of a Node: The total count of subtrees attached to that node is called the degree of the node. The degree
            of a leaf node must be 0. The degree of a tree is the maximum degree of a node among all the nodes in the tree.

    [+] Need for Tree Data Structure
        1. One reason to use trees might be because you want to store information that naturally forms a hierarchy.
        2. Trees (with some ordering e.g., BST) provide moderate access/search (quicker than Linked List and slower than arrays). 
        3. Trees provide moderate insertion/deletion (quicker than Arrays and slower than Unordered Linked Lists). 
        4. Like Linked Lists and unlike Arrays, Trees donâ€™t have an upper limit on the number of nodes as nodes are
           linked using pointers.

    [+] Application of Tree Data Structure:
        File System:  This allows for efficient navigation and organization of files.
        Data Compression: Huffman coding is a popular technique for data compression that involves constructing a binary
        tree where the leaves represent characters and their frequency of occurrence. The resulting tree is used to encode
        the data in a way that minimizes the amount of storage required.
        
        Compiler Design: In compiler design, a syntax tree is used to represent the structure of a program. 
        Database Indexing: B-trees and other tree structures are used in database indexing to efficiently search for and
        retrieve data.
