# ðŸ“š DataStructure

![Data Structure](https://github.com/MiladRahimi93/DataStructure/raw/main/dsatypes.png)

A comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. This repository serves as an educational resource for students, educators, and developers seeking to understand and implement core data structures.

---

## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository provides Python implementations of essential data structures and algorithms, including:

* **Arrays**: Basic operations and manipulations.
* **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists.
* **Stacks & Queues**: Implementation using arrays and linked lists.
* **Trees**: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees.
* **Graphs**: Representation and traversal algorithms.
* **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Counting Sort, and more.

Each implementation is accompanied by:

* Clear and concise code with comments.
* Visual aids (diagrams and images) to illustrate concepts.
* Example usage to demonstrate functionality.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MiladRahimi93/DataStructure.git
cd DataStructure
```

### Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in its respective Python file. For example, to explore array operations:

```bash
python array_traversal.py
```

Refer to the comments within each file for guidance on usage and functionality.
